3. Copy the code from `VideoSpeedify` onto your script file and save it.

4. Ensure you've allowed `Tampermonkey` to run on the browser and then reload your youtube/bilibili TABS.  At this point, you should see a panel in the upper left corner of the video. If no panel is displayed, please refresh and try again or check if there is a problem with your plugin configuration item.

5. You can use `Ctrl + [` to slow down, `Ctrl + ]` to speed up, and `Ctrl + \` to reset the videos or enter the rate you want to switch to quickly in the input box and press the `Enter` key.
